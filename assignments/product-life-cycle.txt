Product Life Cycle – Nokia

INTRODUCTION:

Nokia is a Finland based multinational company which was introduced during the year 1865 by Fredrik Idestam. Not many of us know this but Nokia started by producing cables, pulp and rubber. In 1992, Nokia launched it’s Digi-handheld GSM phone, Nokia 1011. It didn’t provide or launched a variety of models due to it’s less demand and sale. Nokia sold both GSM as well as CDMA phones.

GROWTH:

After a lot of research Nokia then launched it’s first phone without an antenna, Nokia 3210 on March 18, 1999. With more than 160 million units sold this model is one of the most popular and successful phones in history. When I-phone and Samsung came in competition, Nokia then launched phones like N95 to compete with them.

MATURITY:

During this stage, Nokia launched a lot of touch screen models, one of which was N-97 qwerty+touch which was huge success and the most profit was gained.

DECLINE:

Nokia’s poor product design and having it’s main focus on Windows as it’s OS, lead to it’s decline. Nokia is going through this stage now.
